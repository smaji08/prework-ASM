        There Harish and Ganesh started off with short jamming sessions and pursued it even after graduation, which eventually led to the formation of the band. Their musical journey started in an apartment studio where they started experimenting with 
        various compositions of music under the name ‘Studio F6’, which they later renamed as 'Agam'.
